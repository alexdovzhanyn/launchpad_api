# Launchpad API

This is the APi for the launchpad platform.

## Development

1) Clone this repository
2) Make sure you have rails installed
3) Run `bundle install`
4) Run `rake db:setup`
5) Visit localhost:3000

I recommend the Chrome extension JSONView, which formats the Json that's rendered to the webpage in a very readable format.
